# Local Initiatives Directory

This is a basic list of local initiatives across the world. If you find a new
active initiative, we'd like to add it to the list. You may either file an
issue to add or remove initiatives or you can do your own pull request with the
group information.

## Guidelines

You need three things to list a group in the directory.

1.  Group location (city or region, if variable)
2.  Event/group name
3.  Contact point - Please do not list organizers' personal info here. Either link to a group's web/meetup site or list a public profile only. Twitter or Github are usually best for this. PRs with private info will be asked to be edited
