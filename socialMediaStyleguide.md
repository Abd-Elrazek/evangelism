# Social Media Style Guide - io.js
## A guide for publishing under the io.js brand.

> The key points of every section are highlighted in bold for quick scanning. 

### Core Guideline
Be positive wherever and whenever possible.
  * **Engage with the community** in a friendly and outgoing way. Help those who are learning, aid those who know, and support those who teach. Repost or comment when people have successes with io.js. Join a discussion on io.js and contribute your thoughts and opinions on the topic. Stay positive.
  * **Don't talk trash** about people, projects, or companies. We're here to **help the JavaScript community** in adopting and supporting io.js. **Speaking negatively** about someone or something in the community **doesn't help that**. We encourage open discussion of io.js, its community, and its issues.
  * If someone is directly negative toward io.js, adopt the attitude of "**kill 'em with kindness**." Be friendly, responsive, and honest--take what they say, understand it, and respond appropriately and kindly. People are entitled to their opinions about io.js, its community, its contributors, and so on. There's always a way to **turn negative thoughts into positive ones** to aid the adoption and growth of io.js (or any other platform, service, company, etc., for that matter).


### Posting, Commenting and Reposting, Linking, and Liking
#### Posting
**Post relevant information**. It's up to you to decide what's relevant, as there are a wide variety of things that could be important to members or groups within the io.js community. If you think it would be interesting, useful, or fun for the community, post it.

#### Commenting and Reposting
Comment and/or repost when you can if you see...
  * **A question**, directly or indirectly, about io.js that you know the answer to. If there's a channel through which the poster can find the answer, try to direct the poster through your comment to the appropriate channel.
  * **Someone achieve something**. Respond with encouragement and congratulations.
  * **An event in the community**. Try to spread the word about io.js events, meetups, and communities as much as possible.

#### Liking/Favoriting
Like/favorite positive or **interesting posts** whenever you can that are about io.js which you **don't feel a need to comment on or repost**.

#### Important: Mention, link to, and write about relevant people, projects, and organizations whenever possible.
People are very happy when they get official mentions, links, and comments. **Mention people, projects, or organizations directly**, such as through an `@mention` on Twitter, when they can be credited or recognized for something. Link to official repositories, pages, and sites when appropriate. Write posts to raise awareness of exemplary people, projects, and organizations when you have something positive to say about them.


### Language/Writing
#### Use Capital Case for Titles and Headings
Capital case is seen in every heading in this document except for two. **Capital case is where the first letter of every word in a given phrase** (in our case, titles of posts and headings inside a document) **is capitalized**. This excludes specific standard English words such as `a`, `to`, `the`, `an`, `at`, `are`, `of`, `by`, `for`, and so on, unless they are the first word in the title or section of a title (such as after a colon or dash). Some examples would be:

  * Today is a Good Day to Die
  * 42: The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything
  * The Squid: Death's Reawakening
  * Mogar is Ready - The Ultimate Guide to Fighting Bears

As mentioned, you'll notice that two headings in this document _aren't_ in capital case. A title **does not need to be capital case if it is a full sentence, with structure and punctuation**. If your title is a full sentence that follows standard structure and has proper punctuation, it is appropriate to leave it in regular case, with a capital for the first word, and the rest of the words in their normal case.

#### Use Full Sentences, with Capitalization and Punctuation
**Follow proper sentence structure**. For example, in English, write with a capital at the beginning of every sentence, and a period at the end. You don't have to be up-tight; proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation can be used with just about anybody's vocabulary. **This simply ensures the io.js is seen as a professional endeavor**, run by mature human beings. This is extremely important.

#### Use Clear, Concise language
Write clearly and concisely--**use words that convey your message as clearly as possible, minimizing possible confusion about meaning**. Outside of technical terms and messages, use lower-level common language to make content more understandable universally. Writing in this way allows for the message to be heard over the broadest range possible.

#### Use the Active Voice
**Write** post titles, social media entries, and comments **in the active voice**. **The active voice makes the subject directly take action**, while the passive voice has action be put upon the subject. Here are some examples:

---

  **Active**:
  * io.js (*subject*) uses (*action*) a modern version of V8 (*object*).

**Passive**:
  * A modern version of V8 (*object*) is used (*action*) by io.js (*subject*).

  ---

**Active**:
  * io.js (subject) was forked (*action*) from Node.js (*object*), and has been worked on heavily (*secondary, compound action*).

**Passive**:
  * Node.js (*object*) was forked (*action*) into io.js (*subject*), which has since been worked on heavily (*secondary, compound action*).

  ---

**Active**:
  * npm (*subject*) has been minimally changed (*action*) to be compatible (*tricky action-like; "minimally changed" is the action that has been actively done, compatibility was a result of that action*) with io.js (*object*) as well as Node.js (*second object*).

**Passive**:
  * io.js (*object*) compatibility (*tricky action-like; "minimally changed" is the action that has been actively done, compatibility was a result of that action*) minimal changed (*action*) npm (*subject*), which still has Node.js (*second object*) compatibility (*another tricky action-like*).

  ---

There are **several reasons** to write in the active voice over **the passive voice**:
  * The passive voice **can sometimes be awkward or vague**
  * The passive voice **can be unnecessarily wordy**
  * When using the passive voice, it is **easy to accidentally leave out the subject** (the person/thing/entity) that is taking the action.

There are times that using the passive voice is a better choice, but it is good to **keep in mind that the active voice is usually the better choice**. Remembering that, the choice is ultimately yours.
